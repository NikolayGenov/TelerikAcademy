 has unveiled European and UK pricing for  2013 and    
Home Premium, but new business prices are yet to be revealed. 
 
Customers in the UK can buy the subscription-based Office 365  
Home Premium for five PCs or Macs �79.99 per year or �7.99 per month,  
which includes 20GB SkyDrive cloud storage and 60 minutes of Skype calls per month. 
 
For the rest of Europe, the same package costs �99 and �10 respectively.  
Students are being offered a four-year Office 365 University subscription  
for two PCs or Macs for �59.99 in the UK and �79.00 for the rest of Europe. 
 
Microsoft's standalone desktop suite, Office 2013, includes Word, Excel,  
PowerPoint and OneNote, with additional products for Home & Business and  
Professional. The desktop product also gets support on Windows Phone OS 7.5 or  
higher devices through Office Mobile.   
 
Office Home and Student 2013 for one install costs �109.99 in the UK and  
�119 across Europe; Home & Office 2013, which includes Outlook, costs �219.99 in the UK and �269 in Europe. 
 
Office Professional 2013 comes with the addition of Access and Publisher,  
and costs �389.99 in the UK and �539 in Europe. 
 
As usual, consumers in markets outside the US are paying a higher price for  
software. Microsoft revealed 2013 pricing in the US last September, setting  
Office 365 Home Premium costs at $99.99 per year. Given current exchange rates,  
the same product costs roughly US$50 more for European and UK customers than their  
US counterparts. The same price difference applies to Australian customers, where  
the service costs AU$119 (US$124 or �78). 
 
Microsoft is expected to release Office 365 and desktop updates for businesses at the  
end of February, with non-US customers set to pay a premium. In the US, Office 365 for Midsize Businesses  
will costs $15 for between 11 and 250 users, while Office 365 Enterprise & 
 Government will be priced at $20 per seat for anything above 250 users.
